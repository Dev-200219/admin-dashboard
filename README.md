# Admin Dashboard

A pure Front-End project built using nothing but ReactJS and Material UI. It is a complete responsive dashboard working seamlessly on devices with varying widths. It has a home page, products page, users page, orders page and many more. Each with interactive graphs(Recharts), data tables and data grids. It also has a calendar implemented using FullCalendar. It also has seamless navigation between pages using React-Router-DOM. 

The most important learning of this project is re-using of components which you will see in the video's below I have implemented.

Currently all the data in this project is static but for future I wish to learn Backend and then integrate this with a complete database and make it a complete full-stack powered Dashboard.
